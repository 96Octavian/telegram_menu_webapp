    "help" : "Hi there, I'm your super fantastic menu bot! Let me explain my commands!\nSend '/menu' followed by the dishes for the menu, each one on a new line; a '.' (dot) in front of a dish indicates a new course, for example:\n/menu\n.Main course\nPasta with red sauce\nPasta without red sauce\nsalmon dumplings\n.Second course\nLasagna\nHamburger\n.Side dishes\nFries\n.Pizzas\nMargherita\nWurstel\nBismark\n\nThe menu will be created and you will receive back a menu code: share this menu code so that others can place their orders. Place an order by sending '/order menu_code'. Once everyone placed their order, you can get a summary by sending '/summary menu_code.\nTo halt ordinations, send '/close menu_code' and the bot will refuse to take new orders from users; if you change your mind, send '/open menu_code' to allow orders to be placed again.",
